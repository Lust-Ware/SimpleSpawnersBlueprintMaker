# SimpleSpawnersBlueprintMaker
Takes a list of blueprints and converts them into the formal the Simple Spawners system likes! E.g: BP;BP;BP


How to use:
This program depends on the program called "Ark Code Generator", said program generates a list of codes for whatever mod you run it for, and it will tell you spawncodes, engrams etc, this means you MUST have Ark Code Generator, for my program to work.

You can find this program here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H845OEZHiYYU_32cdFYt6Bsdu8o3QMtb/view - Credits to Prome for making this.


after you have downloaded the program above, put it in the folder of the mod you want codes for.
Lets take Primal Fear as an example mod.
You would take Ark Code Generator.exe and put it in the modid folder (ark/shootergame/content/mods/839162288) and run the code generator, wait for it to finish and you now have a list of all available dinos and items etc.


now.. Without this program you would now have to copy all the blueprint paths one by one, and add it to a format the simple spawners likes, this would be tedious and take very long.


this is where my program comes in.
Put my program in the same folder of the Generator program. there should be a "Output.txt" file.

if the output.txt file exists... run my program and voila, you now have all the dinos in the correct format the simple spawners is asking for, and you can just paste the whole thing in the text box in game and ADD.

my program will add a new text file called "NewOutput.txt".
and thats it!
